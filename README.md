# RSA
A collection of programs used to generate and crack RSA keypairs. 
This was originally made for a final for my 400 level Algorithms course.
The final grade was an A.

Originally I tried to write creative code in java but switched to CPP for it's speed and efficiency. Often times my CPP code was 10x as fast. 

# Libraries
The only external library used is GMP. See directory for more details. 
Java BigInteger comes standard with the JDK.

# Math
The code is very math heavy. Much of the code was derived from pseudocode in our class textbook, Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd edition. 
Other resources were used and are linked in comments in the source code where used.
Wikipedia was very helpful for this project.
